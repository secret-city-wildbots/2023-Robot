-- new features --
> Adds temperature readings and alarms for the arm motors.
> Sends the absolute arm encoder readings to the Dashboard.
> Sends the gripper state to the Dashboard.
> Sends the scoring state to the Dashboard.
> Receives arm data from the Dashboard.
> Arm zeroing and unlocking are now tied to Dashboard controls.

> Increases the time threshold before a shifter failure is latched.

-- bugs --
> the robot probably shifts too early, worry less about maintaining motor efficiency and stay in low gear for longer
> need to run additional checks on the AprilTags pose estimates, they are still marked as valid even when too far away for stable calculation
