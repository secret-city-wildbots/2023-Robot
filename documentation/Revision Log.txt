-- Known Issues --
> The robot probably shifts too early, worry less about maintaining motor efficiency and stay in low gear for longer
> Need to run additional checks on the AprilTags pose estimates, they are still marked as valid even when too far away for stable calculation
> Values wired to the default terminal of "NT Get Boolean Array.vi" are not honored
> The ArmKinematicsSimulator.vi has a habit of crashing randomly...
> Some CAN and device references do not match the hardware interfaces spreadsheet because they are being tested using Sidewinder.
> Auto-targeting is hard-disabled in DriverStationGetData.vi.

-- Untested Features --
> Adding an auto command to drive over the CHARGING STATION.
> Adding an auto command to wait for the arm to stop moving.
> Adding an auto command to release a gamepiece.
> Adding an auto command block to change the scoring position.
> Places restrictions on what the gripper can do if the arm is still moving.
> Tying the LimeLight PiP modes to the masters state controller.
> Controlling an actual hopper.
> Controlling an actual gripper.
> Actually controlling the arm motors with the code in OutputArm.vi.
> Full sensor fusion at BioLargo.
> Initial path following at BioLargo.
