-- Known Issues --
> The absolute arm encoders can only be calibrated in the true-zero orientation.
> The robot probably shifts too early, worry less about maintaining motor efficiency and stay in low gear for longer
> Need to run additional checks on the AprilTags pose estimates, they are still marked as valid even when too far away for stable calculation
> Values wired to the default terminal of "NT Get Boolean Array.vi" are not honored

-- Untested Features --
> Integrates the arm state controller with the master state controller.
> Adds a state controller for the arm.
> Actually controlling the arm motors with the code in OutputArm.vi.
> Adding absolute arm encoder sensors.
> Receives arm data and overrides from the Dashboard.
> Arm zeroing and unlocking are now tied to Dashboard controls.
> Sends the gripper state to the Dashboard.
> Sends the scoring state to the Dashboard.
> Sends the absolute arm encoder readings to the Dashboard.
> Adds temperature readings and alarms for the arm motors.
> Merged color sensor game piece detection.
> Merged MVP gripper state controller.
> Full sensor fusion and path following at BioLargo.

-- Releases --

v***
> Manipulator buttons have been configured to control the robot master state.
> Increases the time threshold before a shifter failure is latched.
> More detailed alarm information is now sent to the Driver Station console when a motor overheats.
> Adds a GRNF for the REV Color Sensor v3.
> Foward Kinematics calculations are complete and integreated with the Feed Forward model for the Shoulder, Elbow, and Wrist motors.
> OutputArm infrastucture is in place to send all control and configuration commands to the Shoulder, Elbow, and Wrist motors.

v0.3
> Adding an Inverse and Forward Kinematics simulation for the arm.
> More detailed error messages are sent when a CAN or power fault occurs.
> Created a dedicated "Robot is Enabled" global variable
> Increasing the amount of disabled time before drive motors go into coast to keep from falling off of the CHARGING STATION.
> Cleaning up the Master State Controller.
> AprilTag pose estimates are now flipped based on alliance color.
> All triggered updates are now sent continuously for the first 5 seconds after their first call.
> Tweaked the set behavior of Auto_Path_Suffix for consistency.
> Fixing a bug in the auto play which is used if no auto plays can be loaded from the RoboRIO.
> Suggested autonomous start locations are sent to the Dashboard.
> Re-writes the auto play parser to support variables and setting the suggested robot start location.
> Automatic insertion of the dashboard delay into all auto plays.
> Robot pose estimation has been updated to work with 2023 AprilTags instead of 2022 retro-reflective targets.
> Cleans up the odometry code and fixes sever critical bugs from 2022.
> Switches to "hybrid" odometry which primarily uses the Falcon position data and only uses velocity projections durring shifting events.
